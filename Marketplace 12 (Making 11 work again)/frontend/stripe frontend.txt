This text was copied from Stripe shop nrp. 4 (Info Prefilled) folder inside my codes/stripe Tests
This text was in the frontend directory that contains the react folder also.


- Installations:
npx create-react-app react-app
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
npm install --save @babel/core @babel/preset-env

(Installed babel thing in my-react-app folder)


FYI:
- If you want to render a react component (in this case inside index.js), it has to have a name that starts with a uppercase letter.
