Error encountered: 
Asked from Chat GBT and it answered: 

why i get this? webpack compiled successfully
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.

The warning you're seeing indicates that there's an issue with a dependency, babel-preset-react-app, which is a part of the create-react-app project. The warning suggests that this package is importing @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object without declaring it in its dependencies.

To resolve this warning, you should add @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object to your project's devDependencies. This way, it will be explicitly listed in your package.json file, and you won't rely on it being available through unrelated dependencies.

Here's how you can do it using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object

After running one of these commands, you should see the package added to your devDependencies in your package.json file.


// package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object": "^1.0.0"
    // other devDependencies...
  }
}
By doing this, you are explicitly stating that your project relies on this package, and it should resolve the warning you're currently encountering.





Done: 
- Sellers can onboard
- Metadata about created accounts is retrieved using webhooks. It can be used to identif wich user created the account (also whose account data to update to "Onboarded = true")
- Most of the extra unnecessary text/code deleted
- From transactions the money goes to one of the onboarded sellers specified in backend. Some money comes to my account (platform fee).
