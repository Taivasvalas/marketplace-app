Add credentials: 'include' to the fetch options like below. This will include the cookie with the request.


fetch('https://example.com', {
  mode: 'cors',
  credentials: 'include'
})

In React, the import React statement doesn't import everything; it's specifically used for importing the core 
React library. While it's true that React is a powerful library, it's modular, and you only import the specific 
parts you need in your components. React follows a modular design to keep the library efficient and allow 
developers to include only the necessary features in their projects.

By adding the useEffect with an empty dependency array, the fetch 
requests will only be made once when the component mounts, ensuring 
that data is logged just once instead of multiple times.

When you use ReactDOM.createRoot, it enables Concurrent Mode, which can result in multiple render passes.

React Concurrent Mode is a feature introduced in React 18 (as of my last knowledge update in September 2021). 
It's designed to improve the user experience by making React more responsive and efficient, particularly for large 
and complex applications. Concurrent Mode introduces the concept of "time slicing," allowing React to work on 
multiple tasks simultaneously.

ReactDOM.createRoot is a function provided by React that you can use to create a root instance for Concurrent Mode. 
It allows you to render components in a mode that supports concurrent rendering and time slicing.
